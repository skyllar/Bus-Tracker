# Bus-Tracker
The project aims at simulating an “application platform” which involves tracking a bus movement from a remote app(android). Here are some main components involved in this system:
1. Sensors: Sensors in bus will timely collect data and forward these to the gateway.
2. Gateway: Transmitters the received location data(bus) ato other gateways and ultimately to some filter server via communication channel.
3. Filter Server: They store, filter and forward information(bus location data) to android applications as per their requirement.
4. App Engine: - It is the application Server to which clients (android) connect for bus tracking related information.
